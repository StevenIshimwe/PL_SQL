This Project provides a comprehensive overview of the creation and management of database tables, focusing on the essential attributes and constraints that govern data integrity and relationships within a relational database management system (RDBMS). It covers key tables including **DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE, PROJECT**, and **DEPT_LOCATIONS,** detailing their structures and the relationships between them.

The document outlines the process of inserting data into these tables, illustrating the use of SQL commands to populate the database effectively. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables are preserved and that data remains consistent across the database.

Through this guide, readers will gain insight into best practices for database design, including the organization of data and the implementation of constraints that enhance the reliability and performance of a relational database.

**DEPARTMENT TABLE**: This section presents the structure of the DEPARTMENT table,  including fields like department number (Dnumber), department name (Dname), and constraints such as PRIMARY KEY.
and
**EMPLOYEE TABLE:**  The structure of the EMPLOYEE table, which  includes columns such as first name (Fname), last name (Lname), and department number (Dnumber), along with constraints like a FOREIGN KEY that links to the DEPARTMENT table.

one
 
**PROJECT TABLE:** This area shows the PROJECT table structure, detailing fields  project number (Pnumber), project name (Pname), and relevant constraints.

**DEPT_LOCATIONS TABLE:** Here, the DEPT_LOCATIONS table is outlined, showing fields such as location (Dlocation) and department number (Dnumber), indicating relationships between departments and their respective locations.
 
 

**Data Insertion:** A section shows SQL commands for inserting values into these tables. It likely includes INSERT INTO statements used to populate the DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, and DEPT_LOCATIONS tables.
